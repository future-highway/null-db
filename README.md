# The Null Database

This branch has all the code specifically for the content covered in https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmBx13YvurA. This is an example of what a log based database, enjoy!

If you want to see the latest in the database check out the main branch! Want to join in? feel free too! You can ether join me on the main branch doing some of the bleeding edge work. Or if you would like you can pick a language you are good in and implement this lesson in that language. It would be really cool to see this updated to supportg multiple languages so that it's not an issue for learning.

## This is WIP

I am working on this in my spare time. please, consume it at your own risk. :) if you would like the more guided approach then please watch my video series on it.

## Running the database
This assumes that a recent version of rust has been installed.

`cd rust`

`cargo run`

## CLI use
A recent version of rust is all that is needed! then you can just run it using cargo!

`cd cli`

`cargo run [command]`

## Goal

To have THE best set of examples and educational content on why/when and how databases and data work. From storage, to transmission and the issues and trade offs made.

## Contributions

To be honest, right now you are more then welcome to make a PR, and if you want to make exampels in some other language please feel free to make those PR's. That being said the core databases are too young and new to have really meaningful contributions yet.
